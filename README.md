## Project Description 
I have used `PUG`,`Node.js`, and `Mongo DB` for the  first time in this project.

 
#### What is Pug?
- pug.js, also known as PUG, is a Javascript library that was previously known as JADE. It is an easy-to-code template engine used to code HTML in a more readable fashion. One upside to PUG is that it equips developers to code reusable HTML documents by pulling data dynamically from the API.

## Installation

Pug is available via npm:

```bash
  $ npm install pug
```

#### What is Node Js?
- It is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was originally designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.

#### What is Mongo DB?
- MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.
